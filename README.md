This repository constains all the material, code and data, associated with the paper: 

A Bayesian approach to the deconvolution of 40Ar/39Ar data from multi-component mixtures



Within this github repository are the following folders: 

##Code - This folder contains IPython/Jupyter notebook files that create all outputs and figures in the paper.


##Data - Contains all data used in the case studies in the paper

With Code folder is the code for each case study presented in the Paper. 
The Vanlaningham&Mark folder contains four notebooks for each mixture. Each notebook reads in a dataframe, for the individual data in the code folder. The code is then analysed as shown in each code folder.
